    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.",
    "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.",
    "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
    "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.",
    "I think, therefore I am."
